                ABOUT
              </h2>
              <p>
                Cities: Skylines is my go-to simulation to unwind after a day of admiring local architecture on a walk. 
                I’ve always held a deep admiration for humanity’s ability to construct sprawling cities with intricate transportation networks. 
                Although majority of real-world cities are built atop pre-existing infrastructure leading to major traffic issues down the line (looking 
                at you, Downtown Vancouver), there is a certain charm in observing city history by the layout of roads. Cities: Skylines offers the closest 
                experience to simulating modern city-building from the ground up. 
                A surface-level inspection may lead one to believe the objective to be simple: maximize land use density to increase revenue through 
                taxes, tariffs, and policies. However, Cities: Skylines does not reward shortsighted planning. Success requires careful consideration 
                of district zoning, road layouts, and public transportation systems to prevent road congestion. Cities: Skylines places major emphasis 
                on traffic management as generated income is tied directly to citizen productivity, which is largely reliant on the efficiency of 
                transportation systems.
              </p>
              <h2>
                SCALES THINKING
              </h2>
              <p>
                Cities: Skylines encourages users to employ engineering industry tactics, one of them being scales thinking. This is especially relevant 
                when providing government services such as water, power, waste, and transportation to list a few.

              <li>
                <b>Spatial Scale:</b>       A seemingly simple decision of placing a local hospital in a residential district may actually be a complex 
                decision after taking account of the various spatial scales. One may come to the conclusion that placing a hospital in a quiet 
                suburban neighbourhood can only result in peace and accessibility, an overall net benefit. But if the hospital is not within reach 
                of major roadways or public transit, emergency response times will be significantly hindered. From a district-to-district perspective, 
                the hospital might be inaccessible to neighbouring areas in cases where other hospitals are at full capacity. This is a clear example 
                of local optimization vs. global performance. Public services must be tactfully placed after considering multiple spatial scales.

              <p style="text-align:center; font-size:80%"><i>Sample Power System</i></p>
              <li>
                <b>Temporal Scale:</b> This is especially important in the beginning of a city. A notable example is the decision on picking a power source. When 
                layouts are not yet finalized, it is often wise to construct low initial- and maintenance-cost infrastructure (like wind turbines) 
                to sustain a small amount of housing before generating enough income to invest in greater reliable energy solutions down the line. 
                Beginners are incentivized to purchase a coal power plant immediately, believing that the large excess energy produced could generate 
                early income. However, the lasting impacts of environmental and noise pollution will cause the surrounding land to become unsuitable 
                for future residential or commercial expansion. As the city inevitably expands, the coal plant often forces users to designate permanent 
                industrial zones or expensive landscaping and relocation. Long-term, the high operation and maintenance costs, along with health effects, 
                far outweigh the initial benefits. Cities: Skylines highlights the importance of aligning short-term decisions with long-term planning.

              <p style="text-align:center; font-size:80%"><i>Sample Transit System</i></p>
              <li>
                <b>Economic Scale:</b> serves as the leading motivation to expand and improve your city. Public transit is a primary example of economic 
                scale considerations. If transit is viewed solely from a net revenue lens, it becomes apparent that transit will never turn a 
                profit, and it isn't meant to be. Transit truly shines in the later stages of city building. At the individual level, a bus line 
                is a matter of providing convenience, accessibility, and reduced travel time at the cost of a small fare. On a city-wide scale, 
                however, mass transit can significantly reduce traffic congestion, lower emissions, and boost land values. These benefits also 
                have cascading effects. The reduction in traffic boosts citizen productivity, which can thus improve trade routes of domestic 
                trade and industry. Lower emissions lead to healthier citizens, which may reduce future healthcare expenditures. The boosted land 
                value can result in an increase in taxes, thus increasing overall revenue. Although these benefits aren't always immediately visible, 
                the changes compound over time. One must balance their capital investments with return on investment.

                Welcome to one of the cities I have been developing, currently nameless. At its heart lies a park, inspired by Central Park. 
                Just south, a university hub and integrated bus depot to provide the necessary education to citizens, filling the office zones. 
                To the east, on the other side of the river, are low-income housing and industrial zones, reflecting the city's diverse socioeconomic state. 
                Travelling further north-west, lies the government-run ore mining operations strategically placed near a train stop, offering 7,500 jobs to local 
                residents. The southern coast is home to the tourism district, welcoming visitors travelling overseas via ferry and airport connectivity. 
                The city follows the principles of road hierarchy, allowing smooth traffic flow among the many districts.

                CONCLUSION
              </h2>
              <p>
                Although Cities: Skylines offers a simplified take on city building, it presents a surprisingly deep simulation that challenges 
                individuals to think critically, plan ahead, and adapt to ongoing issues as their cities evolve. 
                An especially engaging aspect of Cities: Skylines is how each decision has rippling effects that one must consider. 
                As the city grows, so too does thstare complexity, forcing you to rethink early choices and plan for sustainability, resilience, 
                and citizen satisfaction.
                I highly recommend Cities: Skylines to anyone who loves the idea of planning, progression, and problem-solving.

                Space Engineers is my go-to sandbox simulator when I need a creative outlet. Specializing in the design and creation of vehicles 
                and infrastructure, the simulator offers a realistic physics engine and a flexible voxel-based building system, enabling limitless 
                creativity. Whether you’re constructing stationary bases, designing spacecraft, or assembling land vehicles, Space Engineers provides 
                all the tools necessary to bring your vision to life. As a sandbox, there’s no defined objective, but that’s where the magic lies. 
                Ambitious players will naturally strive for larger and more complex builds, which demand exponentially more resources. This progression 
                pushes players to develop automated production lines and supply chains, mimicking real-world engineering and logistics challenges.
