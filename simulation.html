              </h2>
              <p>
                Cities: Skylines is my go-to simulation to unwind after a day of admiring local architecture on a walk. 
                I’ve always held a deep admiration for humanity’s ability to construct sprawling cities with intricate transportation networks. 
                Although majority of real-world cities are built atop pre-existing infrastructure leading to major traffic issues down the line (looking 
                at you, Downtown Vancouver), there is a certain charm in observing city history by the layout of roads. Cities: Skylines offers the closest 
                experience to simulating modern city-building from the ground up. 
                A surface-level inspection may lead one to believe the objective to be simple: maximize land use density to increase revenue through 
                taxes, tariffs, and policies. However, Cities: Skylines does not reward shortsighted planning. Success requires careful consideration 
                of district zoning, road layouts, and public transportation systems to prevent road congestion. Cities: Skylines places major emphasis 
                on traffic management as generated income is tied directly to citizen productivity, which is largely reliant on the efficiency of 
                transportation systems.
              </p>
              <h2>
                SCALES THINKING
              </h2>
              <p>
                Cities: Skylines encourages users to employ engineering industry tactics, one of them being scales thinking. This is especially relevant 
                when providing government services such as water, power, waste, and transportation to list a few.

              <p style="text-align:center; font-size:80%"><i>Sample Horrible Placement</i></p>
              <li>
                <b>Spatial Scale:</b>       A seemingly simple decision of placing a local hospital in a residential district may actually be a complex 
                decision after taking account of the various spatial scales. One may come to the conclusion that placing a hospital in a quiet 
                suburban neighbourhood can only result in peace and accessibility, an overall net benefit. But if the hospital is not within reach 
                of major roadways or public transit, emergency response times will be significantly hindered. From a district-to-district perspective, 
                the hospital might be inaccessible to neighbouring areas in cases where other hospitals are at full capacity. This is a clear example 
                of local optimization vs. global performance. Public services must be tactfully placed after considering multiple spatial scales.

              <li>
                <b>Temporal Scale:</b> This is especially important in the beginning of a city. A notable example is the decision on picking a power source. When 
                layouts are not yet finalized, it is often wise to construct low initial- and maintenance-cost infrastructure (like wind turbines) 
                to sustain a small amount of housing before generating enough income to invest in greater reliable energy solutions down the line. 
                Beginners are incentivized to purchase a coal power plant immediately, believing that the large excess energy produced could generate 
                early income. However, the lasting impacts of environmental and noise pollution will cause the surrounding land to become unsuitable 
                for future residential or commercial expansion. As the city inevitably expands, the coal plant often forces users to designate permanent 
                industrial zones or expensive landscaping and relocation. Long-term, the high operation and maintenance costs, along with health effects, 
                far outweigh the initial benefits. Cities: Skylines highlights the importance of aligning short-term decisions with long-term planning.

              <p style="text-align:center; font-size:80%"><i>Sample Transit System</i></p>
              <li>
                <b>Economic Scale:</b> serves as the leading motivation to expand and improve your city. Public transit is a primary example of economic 
                scale considerations. If transit is viewed solely from a net revenue lens, it becomes apparent that transit will never turn a 
                profit, and it isn't meant to be. Transit truly shines in the later stages of city building. At the individual level, a bus line 
                is a matter of providing convenience, accessibility, and reduced travel time at the cost of a small fare. On a city-wide scale, 
                however, mass transit can significantly reduce traffic congestion, lower emissions, and boost land values. These benefits also 
                have cascading effects. The reduction in traffic boosts citizen productivity, which can thus improve trade routes of domestic 
                trade and industry. Lower emissions lead to healthier citizens, which may reduce future healthcare expenditures. The boosted land 
                value can result in an increase in taxes, thus increasing overall revenue. Although these benefits aren't always immediately visible, 
                the changes compound over time. One must balance their capital investments with return on investment.

                Just south, a university hub and integrated bus depot to provide the necessary education to citizens, filling the office zones. 
                To the east, on the other side of the river, are low-income housing and industrial zones, reflecting the city's diverse socioeconomic state.

              </h2>
              <p>
                Although Cities: Skylines offers a simplified take on city building, it presents a surprisingly deep simulation that challenges 
                individuals to think critically, plan ahead, and adapt to ongoing issues as their cities evolve. 
                An especially engaging aspect of Cities: Skylines is how each decision has rippling effects that one must consider. 
                As the city grows, so too does thstare complexity, forcing you to rethink early choices and plan for sustainability, resilience, 
                and citizen satisfaction.
                I highly recommend Cities: Skylines to anyone who loves the idea of planning, progression, and problem-solving.

                Space Engineers is my go-to sandbox simulator when I need a creative outlet. Specializing in the design and creation of vehicles 
                and infrastructure, the simulator offers a realistic physics engine and a flexible voxel-based building system, enabling limitless 
                creativity. Whether you’re constructing stationary bases, designing spacecraft, or assembling land vehicles, Space Engineers provides 
                all the tools necessary to bring your vision to life. As a sandbox, there’s no defined objective, but that’s where the magic lies. 
                Ambitious players will naturally strive for larger and more complex builds, which demand exponentially more resources. This progression 
                pushes players to develop automated production lines and supply chains, mimicking real-world engineering and logistics challenges.

                Following the 6 development stages can prove very useful when deciding on the next build in space engineers.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Problem Scoping
              </h3>
              <p>
                The stakeholder for this stage and every stage moving forward is you, which makes problem scoping straightforward. 
                To walk through each step of the engineering design process, we’ll use the following example.
              </p>
              <p>  
                Let’s say you’ve just spawned in Space Engineers with a drill, welder, grinder, and a basic survival kit. While your handheld drill 
                works for collecting small amounts of ore, it’s inefficient for large-scale resource gathering. Your personal inventory also accepts 
                an extremely limited amount of items. You’ll quickly realize that to collect 
                and transport more material effectively, you’ll need to design and build a basic drill ship.
                At this point, the problem has been identified: your current setup limits your mining efficiency.
                The need: a vehicle that can automate or assist in faster mining with greater storage capacity.
                The goal: design a functional, reliable, and easy-to-maintain drill ship to scale up your resource production.
              </p>
              <br>
              <img src="simulators/concepts.png" width="800vw" height="auto">
              <p style="text-align:center; font-size:80%"><i>Ship Concepts</i></p>
              <h3>
                Idea Generation
              </h3>
              <p>
                This stage is solely based on your creative freedom. Designs can drastically vary based on which qualities 
                you prioritize more in a drilling ship. Above are some sample designs I drafted when it comes to potential candidates. 
              </p>
              <h3>
                Solution Selection
              </h3>
              
              <p>
                The selected solution is highly dependent on the stakeholder, in this case, you. 
                To evaluate your design options effectively, you can use tools such as a Weighted Decision Matrix, Trade-off Table, or Pugh Decision Matrix. 
                These help in assisting you to compare close candidates on how well they meet your needs. Possible constraints include ease of drilling, 
                mobility, size, construction amount, battery-life, and cargo capacity. From the <i>Ship Concepts</i> figure, Ship A prioritizes mobility 
                over mining efficiency. Given the drill placement, Ship A excels at drilling into sloped surfaces or cliff sides. However, when it comes 
                to vertical excavation, Ship A must drill at a downward incline rather than directly beneath itself, limiting its effectiveness for deep 
                hole drilling.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ship B, on the other hand, prioritizes drilling performance over mobility. With drills mounted on the underside, Ship B is optimized 
                for downward drilling, making it ideal for vertical mining operations. The inclusion of additional downward-facing thrusters further 
                improves its carrying capacity, allowing it to handle heavier loads during return trips.
              </p>
              
              <h3>
                Design Development
              </h3>
              <p>
                This stage involves fleshing out the design. You should now consider the placement and quantity of core components such as batteries, 
                hydrogen tanks, hydrogen thrusters, cargo containers, conveyor lines, cockpit, ore detector, and antenna. 
              </p>
              <h3>
                Prototype Testing
              </h3>
              <p>
                The provided tools of blueprints and a testing mode in Space Engineers make it convenient to prototype and test designs 
                before committing valuable resources. This stage often involves multiple iterations, looping through previous design phases 
                as new issues are encountered. As an example, 
                upon completing your first mining ship, you might've realized that you did not include enough hydrogen tanks, causing the ship to 
                have a short run time before needing to refuel. Idenntifying this problem during testing results in a return to the Design Development stage,
                where you can revise your blueprint to account for higher fuel capacity. This iterative loop is common in Space Engineers, where ship design is 
                essential before deployment.   
              </p>

              <p>
                This part can only be achieved after multiple prototypes. You reach this stage when you are fully satisfied with the design and performance of 
                your product, in this case, the mining ship.

              <h2>
                SYSTEMS THINKING
              </h2>
              <p>
                Space Engineers strongly encourages the use of practicing Systems Thinking, especially when building ships. A successful ship 
                requires the balance of subsystems. Every ship is composed of many core components, including power, propulsion, control, cargo, 
                production, and defence. Oftentimes, changing one component will have cascading effects on the others; to increase cargo means 
                potentially more bottom propulsion and gyros to accommodate the additional weight, which may result in additional hydrogen storage 
                to accommodate the overall increased hydrogen usage. Systems thinking goes beyond the ship layout. One must consider how their 
                ship interacts with external systems. Will their ship charge by docking to additional infrastructure, or be self-sustaining 
                via onboard solar panels? What role does the addition of their ship serve in their overall fleet? Only by zooming out can 
                truly effective ships emerge.

              <h3>
                MEGA HAULER
              </h3>
              <p>
                The idea of the MEGAHAULER came to me when I kept finding salvageable ships far from base. I thought to myself, 
                "Wouldn't it be convenient if I had a ship capable of hauling entire wrecks back to base to be salvaged into useful resources?"
              </p>
              <p>
                The solution was clear: create a hauling ship. The hauler ship also serves the additional purpose of a tow truck for your own fleet, 
                helping return ships that are stranded due to low fuel or combat damage. The shape of the MEGAHAULER isn’t just for glamour, its large 
                frame is intentional. Due to the damage mechanics of hydrogen thrusters, large hydrogen thrusters can destroy blocks within a 7-block 
                radius when damaged. To avoid this, I spaced the thrusters as far apart as possible without exceeding a set weight of 2000 tonnes I 
                had selected for this project.
              </p>
              <p>
                The ship’s massive size allows for a high hydrogen tank capacity, making it well-suited for long-distance travel. As such, 
                the MEGAHAULER includes full living quarters at its core: a living room, dining room, washroom, barracks, laboratory, medical 
                bay, and control center. It’s not just a utility ship; it is a relocatable base.
              </p>
              <p>
                Power is primarily received via base docking connections, pulling energy from external infrastructure. However, in emergencies, 
                the MEGAHAULER is equipped with solar panels coating the top of its ring. Within this outer ring are rotating gyroscopes, 
                allowing the ship to passively align itself with the sun for optimal solar charging.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a result, the MEGAHAULER boasts great performance. The massive amounts of downward thrust allow MEGAHAULER to carry up 
                to 15000 tonnes under an Earth-like atmosphere.

              <h3>
                MSB-1
              </h3>
              <p>
                The MSB-1 (Mining Support Base 1) was created to serve as a dedicated charging and ore processing station, 
                designed specifically to accommodate my large space mining ship (not shown). As such, the base is built to 
                be entirely self-sustaining.
              </p>
              <p>
                Being a stationary orbital facility, design priorities such as mass, thruster placement, and maneuverability 
                were of little concern. This allowed the structure to be optimized for maximum internal volume dedicated to storage, 
                ore refining, and part assembly.
              </p>
              <p>
                MSB-1 boasts 12 industrial refineries and 20 assemblers, providing high processing output. To power this factory, 
                copious amounts of batteries line the walls of the maintenance bays. The power needed is supported by the two large 
                solar panel fins mounted on rotatable arms that track the sun for optimal energy collection.
              </p>
              <p>
                MSB-1 features four docking bays, allowing ships to refuel, recharge, and offload raw materials. In addition, 
                defensive armaments are installed to protect the base and its valuable cargo from potential threats.
              </p>
              <p>
                MSB-1 fills a critical gap in my current fleet, acting as a shelter, factory, and charging station all in one. Although 
                requiring massive 
                resource investments, the MSB-1 represents a major milestone upon completion.
